# Vba_challenge
## Description of the challenge
In this challenge assignment, we use **VBA scripting** to analyse generated stock market data. The *code* for the analysis is added to the repository as a Vbs script file.

### Instructions

I created a script that looped through all the stocks for each quarter and outputted the following information:
-   The ticker symbol
-   Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
-   The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
-   The total stock volume of the stock.

#### Note

I used conditional formatting to highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

### Bonus

I added functionality to my script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". The solution matched the provided image.

I made the appropriate adjustments to my VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every quarter) at once.

### Other Considerations

I used the sheet `alphabetical_testing.xlsx` while developing my code. This dataset was smaller and allowed me to test faster. My code ran on this file in just a few seconds.

The script acted the same on every sheet. The joy of VBA was that it took the tediousness out of repetitive tasks with the click of a button.

### Skills Acquired

Through this challenge, I acquired and improved the following skills:

-   Writing and debugging VBA scripts.
-   Using loops to iterate through datasets.
-   Applying conditional formatting based on logical rules.
-   Creating and modifying VBA functions and subroutines.
-   Implementing calculations to determine stock changes and percentages.
-   Using VBA to create and format charts.
-   Enhancing scripts to handle multiple worksheets simultaneously.
-   Developing efficient and reusable code for data analysis.
-   Testing and optimizing code performance on large datasets.
-   Leveraging VBA to automate repetitive tasks in Excel.
